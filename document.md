**Cybersecurity Risk Management for E-commerce Suppliers**

**Client Profile**
Our client is an e-commerce company, where their online sales platform is central to the business and represents the primary revenue source. This platform is a critical asset and a high-priority target for cyber protection.

### 1. Supplier Risk Rating

The initial step in managing cyber risks within the supply chain is to assess and categorize suppliers according to their risk level. This assessment considers the potential impact of a cyber incident involving each supplier. The suppliers are ranked using four risk parameters: access level, data sensitivity, cybersecurity maturity, and incident history.

#### Supplier Risk Levels

**Supplier A – High-Risk Level**
   - **Access Level:** Full access to sensitive customer and transaction data.
   - **Data Sensitivity:** Handles highly sensitive customer and payment information.
   - **Cybersecurity Maturity:** Moderate; recently implemented basic cybersecurity controls but lacks advanced threat detection.
   - **Incident History:** Reported multiple minor security incidents over the past year, with one major breach five years ago.
   
   **Risk Summary:** Given Supplier A's high access level and the nature of data they handle, along with a history of security incidents, this supplier is classified as high-risk. Strengthened controls and continuous monitoring are necessary.

**Supplier B – Medium-Risk Level**
   - **Access Level:** Access to moderate-sensitive customer data but no access to payment details.
   - **Data Sensitivity:** Handles moderate-sensitive customer data, including login credentials.
   - **Cybersecurity Maturity:** Good; advanced cybersecurity protocols in place with periodic updates and auditing.
   - **Incident History:** One minor incident reported three years ago.
   
   **Risk Summary:** Supplier B presents a medium risk due to its moderate-sensitive data handling and good cybersecurity practices. Regular assessments and occasional audits are recommended.

**Supplier C – Low-Risk Level**
   - **Access Level:** Limited access, restricted to non-sensitive operational data.
   - **Data Sensitivity:** Only non-sensitive operational data.
   - **Cybersecurity Maturity:** High; has a robust cybersecurity framework and history of proactive updates.
   - **Incident History:** No incidents reported in the past five years.
   
   **Risk Summary:** Supplier C has limited data access and a strong cybersecurity posture, classifying them as low-risk. Occasional reviews are sufficient to ensure continued compliance.

### 2. Information Security Questionnaire for Site Development Provider

The following questionnaire is designed to assess the security posture of the site’s development provider, ensuring that they meet the e-commerce company’s standards. Each question includes a domain, the question itself, and the expected response, along with recommendations for working with the provider.

| **Domain**           | **Question**                                                                 | **Expected Response**                         | **Recommendations**                                             |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Access Control**   | How is access to the production environment managed?                         | Role-based access control with multi-factor authentication (MFA) for privileged accounts | Ensure all development and production access is tracked and limited.|
| **Data Protection**  | What measures are in place for data encryption in transit and at rest?      | AES-256 for data at rest; TLS 1.2 or above for data in transit | Mandate regular encryption audits and updates to protocols.        |
| **Vulnerability Management** | How frequently are security patches applied to your systems?    | Monthly for regular patches; immediate for critical vulnerabilities | Schedule regular assessments to ensure timely patching.          |
| **Incident Response** | What is the response time for incidents affecting client data?             | Immediate for critical incidents with a 24-hour reporting window | Formalize response times and escalation processes.               |
| **Compliance**       | Are you compliant with GDPR and other applicable regulations?                | Yes, GDPR-compliant with annual reviews | Perform annual audits to verify compliance with current standards.|

#### Effective Supplier Recommendations:
- **Contract Clauses**: Ensure contractual obligations are clearly defined for security requirements.
- **Periodic Audits**: Schedule regular audits to verify compliance with cybersecurity standards.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Regularly monitor supplier performance, especially around critical updates, patching, and response times for incidents.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Work collaboratively with the supplier to improve their cybersecurity posture based on assessments and audit outcomes.
